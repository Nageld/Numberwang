IN HOST TERMINAL:

docker pull cosmtrek/air

THEN GO TO YOUR PROJECT ROOT
THEN RUN:

docker run -it --rm -w "/go/src/Numberwang" -v "$(pwd):/go/src/Numberwang" -p 8000:8000 cosmtrek/air

-w SPECIFIES WORKING_DIR
-v SPECIFIES WHAT VOLUME TO MOUNT
-p ITS OBVIOUS

NOTE cosmtrek/air RELIES ON go.mod TO INSTALL DEPENDENCIES
YOU CAN JUST HAVE NOTHING IN go.mod's requires() AND IT'LL STILL WORK
